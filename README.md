# Valeo codeathon Repo

  This a Repo made during Valeo Codeathon that won us First Prize.
  
  It contains:
 
 ## A Reporter Tool: 
   That can find the documentation of a bug from a Word docx file, map it to the source code and allow the developer to document it.
 ## An Amazon Web Scraper: 
  That can automate the scraping of data for Books on Amazon and write it to a file in json, which can be later plotted.
